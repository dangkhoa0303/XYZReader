Udacity project

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

<h3>Why this Project?</h3>
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

<h3>What Will I Learn?</h3>
Through this project, you will:
  _Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
  _Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
  _Separate an interface into surfaces.
  _Effectively use transitions and motion.


<h3>How Will I Complete this Project?</h3>
You will improve an app for this project:

The app is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.
Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

<h3>Supporting Courses</h3>

  _Developing Android Apps
  _Advanced Android App Development
  _Material Design for Android Developers
  _You can also refer to the Material Design specification.

<h3>Required Tasks</h3>
  _Read the UI Review in the next node.
  _Spend time exploring the current state of the app, looking for ways it could be improved. The app will need multiple improvements. Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UI Review.
  _Execute the improvements!
  _Make a single GitHub repo with your code for the app and submit it through the Nanodegree portal. See the Submission and Evaluation node for detailed instructions.
  _For detailed information on how your project will be assessed, see the Rubric node.
